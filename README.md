# Capstone Proposal

## Overview
### Background
ADHD is a developmental disorder associated with an ongoing pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity.
The symptoms of ADHD can interfere significantly with an individual’s daily activities and relationships.
ADHD symptoms begin in childhood and worsen in the teen years and adulthood.

People with ADHD experience an ongoing pattern of the following types of symptoms:

- Inattention–having difficulty paying attention
- Hyperactivity–having too much energy or moving and talking too much
- Impulsivity–acting without thinking or having difficulty with self-control

Some people with ADHD mainly have symptoms of inattention. Others mostly have symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity.
Some people have both types of symptoms.

ADHD comes in many forms and severities, and teenagers and adults who are undiagnosed often don't even consider they may
have ADHD.

### Data
Data sourced from the [National Survey of Children's Health](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.html) obtained by the United States Census Bureau

### Goal
Create a model that can return the probability that a child from the survey has ADHD, but is undiagnosed.
